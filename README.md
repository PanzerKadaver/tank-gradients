TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK Gradients

Why ?
===
For a exigent client, i have to find a quick and working solution to the "gradient flickering" bug in Chrome (issue #226753 - https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=226753)

The test1 demo page is a gradient with css3 linear-gradient function.

The test2 demo page is the use of my script to obtain the more-or-less same result.

How ?
===
See the test2 page source

And ?
===
I've not planned to add more things. Maybe a new algorithm with HSV if i found time.
